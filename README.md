# react-native-rent-gear-demo

This is a lockdown-side-project thsat I did just for fun.

I follow this amazing motion designer on IG and Dribbble, Taras Migulko ([dribbble.com/ui_migulko](https://dribbble.com/ui_migulko)).

When he published [this animation](https://dribbble.com/shots/11159950-Photo-equipment-rent-app-iOS-mobile-interaction) I really loved it and deicded to replicate it.

I implemented it using React Native ([Expo](https://expo.io/)), and here's how it looks:

I did it so I could play around and get my hand dirty with React Native, Styled Components, TS, etc.. and learn how to make those animations work as similar as possible both on Android and on iOS devices.

**The most exciting part for me was the opportunity to use [`react-native-shared-element`](https://github.com/IjzerenHein/react-native-shared-element) for that cool smooth transition to the Camera Detail Screen.**

I had a lot of fun implementing it and learned a lot in the process.


  To try this app on your iOS or Android device using the EXPO app, just scan this QR code:
