# react-native-rent-gear-demo

This is a lockdown-side-project thsat I did just for fun.

I follow this amazing motion designer on IG and Dribbble, Taras Migulko (https://dribbble.com/ui_migulko)
When he published this thing really loved it and deicded to replicate it.

I did it so I could play around and get my hand dirty with React Native (Expo), Styled Components, TS, etc.. and learn how to make those animations work as similar as possible both on Android and on iOS devices.

I had a lot of fun implementing it and learned a lot in the process.

Let me know if you have any question about this mini-project and please follow Taras Migulko on Dribble and on Instagram too. He is pretty amazing!
